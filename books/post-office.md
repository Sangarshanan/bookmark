Charles bukowski

Okay, so I don't know who recommended I read Bukowski, but I did. Just after the first few chapters, I realized I wasn't going to read another book of his, lol. The book isn’t necessarily bad, and I did manage to finish it—it has some really interesting sections. I think his crude, no-nonsense writing style and characters appeal to the type of reader who fits the image Bukowski wants to project. However, I don't really care much for it. Even though I can relate to the nihilism in his work, this book also made me realize that I value what books can teach me. Whether it’s offering a new perspective on something mundane or teaching me about a topic I’m curious about, this book didn’t do any of that for me. It drags on regularly and never really goes anywhere, though certain parts in the middle were interesting. It wasn’t a hard read at all. Maybe I should try more of Bukowski's short stories or poems—I hear they’re different
