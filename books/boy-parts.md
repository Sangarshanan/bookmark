Holy shit ! this book was written in 2020 and it shows, saw someone on goodreads call it American Pyscho for hot girls and that I would say is a
very accurate description of this book. It goes from edgy to absurd and ends in mania

its a fun read tho lmao especailly the final few chapters after the "big title reveal"
