I am truly a lover of this guy and his books

There is a certain part of all of us that lives outside of time. Perhaps we become aware of our age only at exceptional moments and most of the time we are ageless.

Hate traps us by binding us too tightly to our adversary. I cannot hate them because nothing binds me to them; I have nothing in common with them.

Do you realize what is the eternal precondition of tragedy? The existence of ideals which are considered more valuable than human life. And what is the precondition of wars? The same thing.

The age of tragedy can be ended only by the revolt of frivolity.

The opinion they advocate is itself not all that important to them. But because once they have made this opinion an attribute of their self, attacking it is like stabbing a part of their body.

we will never find out why we irritate people, what bothers people about us, what they like about us, what they find ridiculous; for us our own image is our greatest mystery.

Philosophers can tell us that it doesn’t matter what the world thinks of us, that nothing matters but what we really are. But philosophers don’t understand anything. As long as we live with other people, we are only what other people consider us to be.

Fame adds a hundred-fold echo to everything that happens to us. And it is uncomfortable to walk the world with an echo.

without the art of ambiguity there is no real eroticism and the stronger the ambiguity, the more powerful the excitement.

we have become accustomed to consider marriage automatically as something unpoetical.

The love of Anna Karenina and Vronski ended with their first sexual encounter, after which it became nothing but a story of its own disintegration and we hardly know why: had they made love so poorly? or, on the contrary, had they made love so beautifully that the intensity of their pleasure released a sense of guilt

when someone steps on my foot, only I feel the pain. The basis of the self is not thought but suffering, which is the most fundamental of all feelings. While it suffers, not even a cat can doubt its unique and uninterchangeable self. In intense suffering the world disappears and each of us is alone with his self. Suffering is the university of egocentrism.

creativity means more than power, art more than politics; that works of art, not wars or aristocratic costume-bals, are immortal.

To be mortal is the most basic human experience and yet man has never been able to accept it, grasp it, and behave accordingly.

human life has never been subjected to mathematical research. Take time, for example. I long for an experiment that would examine, by means of electrodes attached to a human head, exactly how much of one’s life a person devotes to the present, how much to memories and how much to the future.

‘Existential mathematics

Shame means that we resist what we desire, and feel ashamed that we desire what we resist.

Everyone is eager for admiration and not for pleasure. For appearance and not for reality. Reality no longer means anything to anyone.

if we cannot accept the importance of the world, which considers itself important, if in the midst of that world our laughter finds no echo, we have but one choice: to take the world as a whole and make it the object of our game; to turn it into a toy.
