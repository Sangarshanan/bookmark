# Kafka on the Shore

May 2022 | Haruki Murakami
   
This was my first Murakami book, It manages to be mystical and super fucking creepy at the same time. It brings in oedipus and sprinkles some magic on it. 
It was a satisfying read and i really love some of the world building and the metaphors Murakami uses to really sculpt his characters and their surroundings.

You're afraid of imagination. And even more afraid of dreams. Afraid of the responsibility that begins in dreams. But you have to sleep, and dreams are a part of sleep. When you're awake you can suppress imagination. But you can't suppress dreams.

Happiness is an allegory, unhappiness a story.

"Kafka, in everybody's life there's a point of no return. And in a very few cases, a point where you can't go forward anymore. And when we reach that point, all we can do is quietly accept the fact. That's how we survive."

we accept irony through a device called metaphor.

"Japan has its share of problems," Oshima says, smiling, "but we sure know how to make a sound system.

"The pure present is an ungraspable advance of the past devouring the future. In truth, all sensation is already memory."

"The strength I'm looking for isn't the kind where you win or lose. I'm not after a wall that'll repel power coming from outside. What I want is the kind of strength to be able to absorb that outside power, to stand up to it. The strength to quietly endure things- -unfairness, misfortune, sadness, mistakes, misunderstandings."

all civilization is the product of a fenced-in lack of freedom. The Australian Aborigines are the exception, though. They managed to maintain a fenceless civilization until the seventeenth century. They're dyed-in-the-wool free. They go where they want, when they want, doing what they want. Their lives are a literal journey. Walkabout is a perfect metaphor for their lives. When the English came and built fences to pen in their cattle, the Aborigines couldn't fathom it. And, ignorant to the end of the principle at work, they were classified as dangerous and antisocial and were driven away, to the outback. So I want you to be careful. The people who build high, strong fences are the ones who survive the best. You deny that reality only at the risk of being driven into the wilderness yourself."

"Listen up--there's no war that will end all wars," Crow tells me. "War breeds war.

"Can nothingness increase?"

Beyond the edge of the world there's a space where emptiness and substance neatly overlap, where past and future form a continuous, endless loop. And hovering about there are signs no one has ever read, chords no one has ever heard.

"It's like when you're in the forest, you become a seamless part of it. When you're in the rain, you're a part of the rain. When you're in the morning, you're a seamless part of the morning. When you're with me, you become a part of me."

"Every one of us is losing something precious to us," he says after the phone stops ringing. "Lost opportunities, lost possibilities, feelings we can never get back again. That's part of what it means to be alive.
