Sci Fi novel from Blake Crouch

https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/27833670

I liked the storytelling and it did manage to keep me hooked a bit but i gotta say a lot of the times the twists were too predictable and a lot of multiverse aspects are a bit overcooked at this point with fkton of marvel movies coming out every single week

not bad tho fun read. 6/10
