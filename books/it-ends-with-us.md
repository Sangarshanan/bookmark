# it ends with us

Aug 2022 | Colleen Hoover

Started off like a cheesy romcom and I began thinking Hmmm this is not for me but it took a turn, the kind i kinda expected
but still hit hard when it did

Paints a very real picture of abuse and what the victims go thro, The way describes lily's thoughts, her overthinking and 
the conclusions she comes to seems very raw & real. I felt for all the characters since they were built so well around the story

Epilogue gave a glimpse into the life of the author and how the story was modelled after her own mother who is a victim of abuse 
herself and how her dad was not a bad person but just had bad moments, this is stressed further in the book

It ends with us is very powerful with its message...
