# the unbearable lightness of being

Dec 2021 | Milan Kundera

Melancholy is one way to describe this book that absolutely destroyed me towards the end, It's beautiful 
in the way it ties deep philosophical concepts with a coherent storyline.

In the sunset of dissolution, everything is illuminated by the aura of nostalgia, even the guillotine.

A single metaphor can give birth to love.

Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels with someone, for someone a pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echoes.

Anyone whose goal is 'something higher' must expect someday to suffer vertigo. What is vertigo? Fear of falling? No, Vertigo is something other than fear of falling. It is the voice of the emptiness below us which tempts and lures us, it is the desire to fall, against which, terrified, we defend ourselves

if you're looking for infinity, just close your eyes

what remains of life when a person rejects what he previously considered his mission.

The characters in my novels are my own unrealized possibilities. That is why I am equally fond of them all and equally horrified by them.

Human life occurs only once, and the reason we cannot determine which of our decisions are good and which bad is that in a given situation we can make only one decision;

Einmal ist keinmal. What happens but once might as well not have happened at all.

Stalin's son, who ran to electrocute himself on the barbed wire when he could no longer stand to watch the poles of human existence come so close to each other as to touch, when there was no longer any difference between sublime and squalid, angel and fly. God and shit

Before we are forgotten, we will be turned into kitsch. Kitsch is the stopover between being and oblivion

True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power. Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buried from view), consists of its attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.

Dogs were never expelled from Paradise. Karenin knew nothing about the duality of body and soul and had no concept of disgust. That is why Tereza felt so free and easy with him. (And that is why it is so dangerous to turn an animal into a machina animata, a cow into an automaton for the production of milk. By so doing, man cuts the thread binding him to Paradise and has nothing left to hold or comfort him on his flight through the emptiness of time.)

Dogs relish routine, they are happy waking up on the same bed, walking on the same street & catching the same ball over and over. Humans get sick of this repetition, We look for paradise which is essentially the need to be not human
