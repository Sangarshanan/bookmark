# Existentialism Is a Humanism

September 23

I read this book in the forests of Kookal which added a bit of profoundness, Here 
Jean-Paul Sartre tries to defend Existentialism from critics & it ends up being a good introduction to the philosophy

**Existence precedes Essence** for humans unlike a pen that is designed to write before it is created, this means 
we got the freedom to define ourself through actions or *subjectivity* This is the essential human condition

> “There is no reality except in action. Man is nothing else than his plan; he exists only to the extent that he fulfills himself; he is therefore nothing else than the ensemble of his acts, nothing else than his life.”

Because the human condition is universal every action you do is for humanity as a whole and each person becomes 
**responsible for all men** so every action ask you do is the action of humanity as a whole! 

> “Everything happens to every man as if the entire human race were staring at him and measuring itself by what he does. So every man ought to be asking himself, "Am I really a man who is entitled to act in such a way that the entire human race should be measuring itself by my actions?" And if he does not ask himself that, he masks his anguish.”

Some people believe that they are not in control of their own actions so that they can avoid feeling responsible 
for what they do, Satre calls this **Bad faith** he calls out the religious fanatics who choose
to believe in a higher power or deterministic universe so as to be relieved of their moral responsibility

> “Those who conceal from themselves this total freedom, under the guise of solemnity, or by making deterministic excuses, I will call cowards. Others, who try to prove their existence is necessary, when man's appearance on earth is merely contingent, I will call bastards.”

i like existentialism, its super chill especially as someone who heavily relates to Optimistic nihilism
