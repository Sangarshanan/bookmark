# The vegetarian

This surreal story goes to some crazy places that I never really expected it to, The commentary on desire, obsession, dreams, societal expectations and not even a little bit about vegetarianism. I feel like that is just a metaphor of how this woman just keeps going further and further away from expectations of not just being a woman but also being human. It's crazy and i love it.

Also this book actually won the Nobel Prize in Literature?! Damn
