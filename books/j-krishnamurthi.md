This was J Krishnamurthy biography written by Pupul Jayakar

Very interesting history lesson on the Theosophical society & a glimpse into India during the British times.

**Take a thought & finish that thought to completion** This is quite difficult cause our mind is crazy, we are never 
thinking about one thing at a time and there is too much chaos which can give rise to confusion and so on and on. So i hope
one day you just sit and meditate on a thought, A single idea, To it's completion

counter culture is dumb and so is popular culture, we are all influenced by something and its OK. takes a burden
off your shoulder when you internalise you are not always in control nor are you the center of the universe
