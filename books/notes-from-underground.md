# Notes from the Underground

Fyodor Dostoevsky | July 2024

The book is a diary of a guy has reached boss level in overthinking but weirdly as much as you can ridicule the guy which he openly welcomes you to in the book, you sometimes find yourself relating to him in matters, i find that a very interesting study on how paradoxical the human mind is.

Some notes from it..

Nature does not ask your permission, she has nothing to do with your wishes, and whether you like her laws or dislike them, you are bound to accept her as she is, and consequently all her conclusions. A wall, you see, is a wall ... and so on, and so on.â€™

My jests, gentlemen, are of course in bad taste, jerky, involved, lacking self-confidence. But of course that is because I do not respect myself. Can a man of perception respect himself at all?


I invented adventures for myself and made up a life, so as at least to live in some way.

In consequence again of those accursed laws of consciousness, anger in me is subject to chemical disintegration. You look into it, the object flies off into air, your reasons evaporate, the criminal is not to be found, the wrong becomes not a wrong but a phantom,

do you know, perhaps I consider myself an intelligent man, only because all my life I have been able neither to begin nor to finish anything. Granted I am a babbler, a harmless vexatious babbler, like all of us. But what is to be done if the direct and sole vocation of every intelligent man is babble, that is, the intentional pouring of water through a sieve?

Shower upon man every earthly blessing, drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer spite, man would play you some nasty trick.


A True autobiography is almost an impossibility, and that man is bound to lie about himself.


With me loving meant tyrannising and showing my moral superiority.
