# God of small things

Arundhati Roy, Oct 2025

Ok so in the beginning you get a lot of description and information about characters that you dont know at all and have random temporal jumps but just stick to it cause once you got it, I could literally not put the book down. God of small things is a story of post colonial india, of family, love, shame, pride, caste, trauma and so many more things, It was deeply personal as a person who grew in an orthodox family in South India.


It is curious how sometimes the memory of death lives on for so much longer than the memory of the life that it purloined.

Where do old birds go to die? Why don’t dead ones fall like stones from the sky?

In the country that she came from, poised forever between the terror of war and the horror of peace, Worse Things kept happening.

Ammu said that human beings were creatures of habit, and it was amazing the kind of things they could get used to. You only had to look around you, Ammu said, to see that beatings with brass vases were the least of them.

because our minds have been invaded by a war. A war that we have won and lost. The very worst sort of war. A war that captures dreams and re-dreams them. A war that has made us adore our conquerors and despise ourselves.

This was the trouble with families. Like invidious doctors, they knew just where it hurt.

After Independence they found they were not entitled to any government benefits like job reservations or bank loans at low interest rates, because officially, on paper, they were Christians, and therefore casteless. It was a little like having to sweep away your footprints without a broom. Or worse, not being allowed to leave footprints at all.

“Sorry doesn’t make a dead man alive,” Estha said.

The taxi smelled of sleep. Old clothes rolled up. Damp towels. Armpits. It was, after all, the taxi driver’s home. He lived in it. It was the only place he had to store his smells.

The trees were still green, the sky still blue, which counted for something. So they went ahead and plugged their smelly paradise—God’s Own Country they called it in their brochures—because they knew, those clever Hotel People, that smelliness, like other peoples’ poverty was merely a matter of getting used to.

Ancient stories were collapsed and amputated. Six-hour classics were slashed to twenty-minute cameos.
==========


The air was full Of Thoughts and Things to Say. But at times like these, only the Small Things are ever said. The Big Things lurk unsaid inside.

The Great Stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again. The ones you can enter anywhere and inhabit comfortably. They don’t deceive you with thrills and trick endings. They don’t surprise you with the unforeseen. They are as familiar as the house you live in. Or the smell of your lover’s skin. You know how they end, yet you listen as though you don’t. In the way that although you know that one day you will die, you live as though you won’t. In the Great Stories you know who lives, who dies, who finds love, who doesn’t. And yet you want to know again.

That is their mystery and their magic

Rahel never wrote to him. There are things that you can’t do, like writing letters to a part of yourself. To your feet or hair. Or heart.

Things can change in a day.

Littleangels were beach-colored and wore bell-bottoms. Littledemons were mudbrown in AirportFairy frocks with forehead bumps that might turn into horns.

“If you’re happy in a dream, Ammu, does that count?” Estha asked. “Does what count?” “The happiness—does it count?” She knew exactly what he meant, her son with his spoiled puff. Because the truth is, that only what counts counts.
==========


You know how they end, yet you listen as though you don’t. In the way that although you know that one day you will die, you live as though you won’t.

He tells stories of the gods, but his yarn is spun from the ungodly, human heart. The Kathakali Man is the most beautiful of men. Because his body is his soul. His only instrument.
==========


In the Heart of Darkness they mock him with their lolling nakedness and their imported attention spans. He checks his rage and dances for them. He collects his fee. He gets drunk. Or smokes a joint. Good Kerala grass. It makes him laugh. Then he stops by the Ayemenem Temple, he and the others with him, and they dance to ask pardon of the gods.

certainly no beast has essayed the boundless, infinitely inventive art of human hatred. No beast can match its range and power.

And there it was again. Another religion turned against itself. Another edifice constructed by the human mind, decimated by human nature.

The twins were too young to know that these were only history’s henchmen. Sent to square the books and collect the dues from those who broke its laws. Impelled by feelings that were primal yet paradoxically wholly impersonal. Feelings of contempt born of inchoate, unacknowledged fear, Civilization’s fear of nature, men’s fear of women, powers fear of powerlessness. Man’s subliminal urge to destroy what he could neither subdue nor deify. Men’s Needs.

The way her body existed only where he touched her. The rest of her was smoke

It was human history, masquerading as God’s Purpose, revealing herself to an under-age audience.
