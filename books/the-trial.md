## The Trial 

Whenever someone asks me what i am doing and i don't really feel like answering i come up an elaborate lie backed by incredibly 
factual logic so they can't really catch me in the lie. this has led to me hearing "I can never tell when you're kidding" a lot.

The Trial by Franz Kafka is right up my lane in that aspect even tho i feel a lot of times it takes a long detour exploring elements that
do not contribute anything i.e some parts bored me and i almost gave up reading it but then i went on a trip to Prague and thot it would be really neat to finish the book there! so I did

i liked it in the end, i found it hilarious in a lot of places and the way it just did not give you any information to keep everything in the book nothing but a metaphor.

maybe its a serious commentary on our convoluated system of bureaucracy or an elborate dark comedy sketch, maybe it's just dystopian scifi aburdism on the all seeing internet gods of the future
